# Extracted from Debian Maintainer Guide:
#
# You may need to run dh_* commands invoked via the new dh with added arguments,
# or to run additional commands with them, or to skip them. For such cases, you
# create an override_dh_foo target with its rule in the rules file defining an
# override_dh_foo target for the dh_foo command you want to change. It basically
# says run me instead.
# 
# Please note that the dh_auto_* commands tend to do more than what has been
# discussed in this (over)simplified explanation to take care of all the corner
# cases. It is a bad idea to use override_dh_* targets to substitute simplified
# equivalent commands (except for the override_dh_auto_clean target) since it
# may bypass such smart debhelper features.
# 
# So, for instance, if you want to store system configuration data in the
# /etc/gentoo directory instead of the usual /etc directory for the recent
# gentoo package using Autotools, you can override the default --sysconfig=/etc
# argument given by the dh_auto_configure command to the ./configure command by
# the following:
#
override_dh_auto_configure:
	dh_auto_configure --buildsystem=cmake -- -DUSE_CTEST=off
# 
# The arguments given after -- are appended to the default arguments of the
# auto-executed program to override them. Using the dh_auto_configure command is
# better than directly invoking the ./configure command here since it will only
# override the --sysconfig argument and retain any other, benign arguments to
# the ./configure command.
# 
# If the Makefile in the source for gentoo requires you to specify build as its
# target to build it [52], you create an override_dh_auto_build target to enable
# this.
# 
#override_dh_auto_build:
#	dh_auto_build -- build
# 
# This ensures $(MAKE) is run with all the default arguments given by the
# dh_auto_build command plus the build argument.
# 
# If the Makefile in the source for gentoo requires you to specify the
# packageclean target to clean it for the Debian package instead of using
# distclean or clean targets, you can create an override_dh_auto_clean target to
# enable it.
# 
# override_dh_auto_clean:
#	$(MAKE) packageclean
# 
# If the Makefile in the source for gentoo contains a test target which you do
# not want to run for the Debian package building process, you can use an empty
# override_dh_auto_test target to skip it.
# 
# override_dh_auto_test:
# 
# If gentoo has an unusual upstream changelog file called FIXES,
# dh_installchangelogs will not install that file by default. The
# dh_installchangelogs command requires FIXES as its argument to install it.
# 
# override_dh_installchangelogs:
#	dh_installchangelogs FIXES
